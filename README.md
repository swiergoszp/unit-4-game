A Legend of Zelda themed click-game.

The games premise is simple, use the 4 gems of differing values to eventually make a number that equals the one given at the start of each round. 

A random number generator picks a number to start, as well as the beginning of following rounds. Each gem has an rng that also changes its value after every round as well. 

This game exists in free space to serve as an example to learn from, and maybe entertainment for the easily amused.

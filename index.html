            <p class="strange">The strength of the Infinity Stones are unrivaled. Things of legend, 
                they are said to be the remnants of forces that existed even before 
                the creation of our universe.</p>

            <p class="strange">Dr. Strange, the Sorcerer Supreme, has managed to locate all six of them.
                However in order to contain them and keep them hidden, their power must
                be nullified. Luckily, Strange has devised a strategy to use the stones
                against one another to supress their strength.</p>

            <p class="strange">Each stone vibrates at a different frequency from the others. Using these
                different vibrational patterns, Strange believes he can create layers of
                magic barriers to do the trick. This is where you come in...</p>

            <p class="strange">In order to discover the frequency and how much energy it contains, 
                you mush interact with stones. Dr. Strange had provided you with a magical
                set of blacksmith tong he calls the "Pincers of Rathalos". Using this 
                artifact allows Strange the time he needs to add the stones power to
                his spell.</p>
